# Backend Engineering Challenge


Welcome to our Engineering Challenge repository 🖖

## Challenge Objective

This challenge was to build a simple command line application that parses a stream of events and produces an aggregated output. In this case, we're interested in calculating, for every minute, a moving average of the translation delivery time for the last X minutes.

If we want to count, for each minute, the moving average delivery time of all translations for the past 10 minutes we would call your application like (feel free to name it anything you like!).

	unbabel_cli --input_file events.json --window_size 10
	
The input file format would be something like:

	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:11:08.509654","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa5","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "easyjet","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 20}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:15:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa4","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "easyjet","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 31}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:23:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75bb33","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "booking","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 100, "duration": 54}


The output file would be something in the following format.

```
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:11:00", "average_delivery_time": 0}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:12:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:13:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:14:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:15:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:16:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:17:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:18:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:19:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:20:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:21:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:22:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:23:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:24:00", "average_delivery_time": 42.5}
```

#### Notes

To run this command line application, just have the python script located in the same directory as you have the input json file. Also, bellow is an example of a command to run this appliction and get a preview of the last 10 min

	python3 unbabel_cli --input_file events.json --window_size 10
	

You can find comments describing code functionality in the .py file itself.

Instead of using --input_file and --window_size, you can just use -i or -w and pass the argument after. You can also use -h or --help command to get a view of the help menu.
